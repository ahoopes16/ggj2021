# Seymour High School's Lost & Found

## Summary
You've volunteered to run Seymour High School's Lost and Found for an afternoon! Lucky you!

In the beginning, you will sort the objects into boxes by dragging and dropping them. Sort them based on whatever makes sense to you - the goal is to be able to find items quickly as people give you hints about what they've lost. Once all of the items have been sorted, people will start coming and asking for their items. The faster you get all of the people their items, the better!
